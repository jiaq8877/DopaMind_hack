        Welcome to the dopaMind, a website that caters for any student who is
        having or has had any mental health problems.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mental health is a hot topic, but there is still not enough public
        awareness. Many students (especially Imperial students) are experiencing
        MH problems, but many of them haven’t realised. Only few people actively
        searches for MH help from websites, apps, wellbeing support from
        counsellors, most people won't start to look for help until they’ve hit
        a really low point. This is already too late and we would like to avoid
        it. The eariler to solve for problems, the easier it would be. The best
        way is just to prevent mental health problems by maintaining our minds
        healthy.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
        Apart from the lack of awareness, it is usually not convenient for
        students who need help to actually get help. Some people think it’s a
        lot of work to get help, so they end up not doing it or giving it up on
        the half way. Besides, many websites provide overwhelming information,
        so that students would be reluctant to read it through. Therefore, make
        the support service accessible, pproachable, easy to read and easy to
        pick up is a key to improve the mental health for people.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
        Our mission is to normalizing mental health by creating awareness on our
        daily platforms, and provide students some specific easy-to pick
        everyday solutions.
